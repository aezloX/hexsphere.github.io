        <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
                Hexsphere, is a <span id="age"></span>-year-old indie game developer making games in Scratch and graphic art and UI in <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" target="_blank">Affinity Designer</a>. He got his passion for graphic design and coding in Scratch and in HTML from a lifelong love of computers and the things that can be made with them.
				<br>
				He started Scratch in 2013 and has moved only once to his current account <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/Hexsphere" target="_blank">Hexsphere</a>. While doing Scratch he has made a <a href="http://hexsphere.com/AngularJSOrderForm/" target="_blank">AngularJs Order Form</a>, an HTML5 WebGL Tennis Game, and of course, this website.
            </p>
        <h2>History Of This Website</h2>
            <p>
				After working on Scratch for a while, he decided to broaden his coding knowledge, so he created an HTML website as a side project. Since he already had a wix website, he didn’t think this would go anywhere, but after seeing <a href="http://www.minimalion.com/" target="_blank">Minimalion’s HTML website</a>, he thought it would be fun to renovate that old sloppy site he had made for fun. So after a couple months of hard work and 52 github commits later, he can bring to you this website.
