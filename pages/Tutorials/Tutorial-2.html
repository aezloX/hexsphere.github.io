			GitHub Tutorial: <br> How to host your own website using GitHub Pages!
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			In this tutorial I will show you how to host your own website using a totally free website hosting service by GitHub called <a class="underline-link" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
			<br> Lets do this! First, you're going to need a GitHub account. You can create one <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home" target="_blank">here</a>.
			<br> After you've created a GitHub account, go to GitHub's home page and click on the "Start a project" button, or the plus icon on the right side of the header. &#40;If your home page doesn't look like this because you already have created a GitHub account, then just click the plus button to make a new repository&#41;
		</p>
		<img src="/resources/images/Tutorial-2-Images/1.png">
		<p>
			Once you've created a repository, name it your username.github.io (e.i. hexsphere.github.io). You don't have to give it a description, but it makes the next few steps easier if you do, so it's up to you. ðŸ™‚ If you did decide to make a description check the "Initialize this repository with a README" checkbox.
		</p>
		<img src="/resources/images/Tutorial-2-Images/2.png">
		<p>
			Great job so far! If everything went right, you have created your first GitHub repository! ðŸ˜€ Now to clone it onto your computer. Before you can clone the repository, you need the <a class="underline-link" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub desktop app</a>. After you've downloaded and got GitHub desktop running on your computer, go back to your browser and  click the green "Clone or download" button and click the "Open in Desktop" button.
		</p>

		<p>
			Okay, now that you have cloned your repository, you need add the files that make up a website. If you are using this tutorial to host a website that someone else created for you, you need to download them, otherwise you can skip these next few steps. <br> There are two different options you can choose here. One option is to open your computers file viewing application and go to the file path you set for the repository &#40;For Windows it should be: This PC &#62; Documents &#62; GitHub &#62; username.github.io. For Mac it should just go to your user folder&#41; and drag and drop the files into the repository folder.
		</p>
		<img src="/resources/images/Tutorial-2-Images/4.png">
		<p>
			 Then, go back to the GitHub desktop app and go to the changes tab, you'll see all the files you just put in the repository. You need to commit them in order to upload them to GitHub.com. Enter a commit title and click the "Commit to master" button. Then click the sync button to upload the changes to the repository's webpage.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second method is to simply upload them to the repository's webpage. Go to your repository's webpage by either clicking on the gear icon in the GitHub desktop app and clicking "View on GitHub" button, or going to GitHub.com and clicking on the repository in the "Your repositories" box. Then, click the Upload files button and select your files. Now, there's a problem with this method, if you try to upload a folder, GitHub won't upload it, so you'll have to use the first step if you want to upload folders.

			Next, you need to make your website live! Go to your repository's webpage and click on the settings tab and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and click on the drop down and select the master branch, then click the save button.

			Good job! You've set up a repository, added files, and used GitHub Pages to host your website! <br>
